# Ajax Project(Simple Weather App)
Simple Weather app is based on Udemy Javascript Course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. This app allows users to input city and bring the temperature and description about the weather by making API calls with Ajax. The metric-Celsius temperature is converted to fahrenheit temperature through this program.
